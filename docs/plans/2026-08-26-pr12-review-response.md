# PR #12 Review Response — Implementation Plan

## Context

`dmjohnston89/dndbeyond-mcp#12` (branch `add-legacy-sensing-for-more-entities`, base `d31a0d0`) adds edition-aware
reference lookups, character-independent subclass lookups, a rebuilt `search_class_features`, and `campaignId`
threading across 15 tools. The maintainer is inclined to merge but raised three pre-merge blockers, three
discussion items, and four housekeeping items.

I verified every claim against the code rather than taking it at face value. **All three blockers are real
bugs**, and two of them are *broader* than the reviewer described. Build is clean (`tsc --noEmit`, exit 0) and
**344 tests pass across 32 files** — the reviewer's numbers are exact.

Goal of this work: land the three blockers, answer the two direction questions, clear housekeeping, and finish
the edition-awareness feature **uniformly across every compendium entity** — including spells and conditions,
whose earlier implementations diverge from the pattern this PR establishes and which the PR's own README now
makes claims about (see Part D). Target release: **v0.7.0**.

Two decisions were deferred to the maintainer rather than taken unilaterally: `get_condition`'s 2014 default
(**D2b**) and the shape of a durable edition preference (**D7b**). Both are now resolved — see D2b/D7b below.
One step remains blocked on the author's machine: the live items probe (**A1**), which needs auth this
planning session doesn't have.

## Part A — Pre-merge blockers

### A1. `edition` on `search_items` / `get_item` may be a silent no-op

**Accurate?** **Yes, and the reviewer understated the reach.**
- `DdbItem.isLegacy` was indeed introduced by this PR (`src/tools/reference.ts:901`; the `+  isLegacy: boolean;`
  line is in `b4864d9`'s diff). `sources` at `:897` pre-dated it.
- The only assertion is a unit test with a hand-built mock that *sets* the field:
  `tests/tools/reference-editions.test.ts:229-238`. Live item coverage
  (`tests/live/read-reference.test.ts:101-118`) passes no `edition` and asserts no tag. Grep for
  `isLegacy`/`sources`/`sourceId` across `tests/live/` returns **zero** hits.
- The failure mode is exactly as described: `collapseByEdition` → `pickByEdition`
  (`reference.ts:470-516`) tests `Boolean(c.isLegacy) === wantLegacy`, and `Boolean(undefined) === false`,
  so a missing field classifies every item as 2024. `get_item { edition: "2014" }` would then always return the
  2024 item.

**Gap in the reviewer's framing (worth saying in the reply):** "every other edition-aware entity in this PR got
live coverage" is **not true**. Classes, subclasses, races and backgrounds have live edition assertions
(`read-reference.test.ts:149-191`, `:200-215`, `:331-350`, `:362-382`), but **feats, class features and racial
traits do not** — feats' live tests (`:120-138`) only check the name and length, and `searchRacialTraits` has no
live test at all. Items are the highest-risk case because the flag is *assumed present in the payload* rather
than *derived*, but the coverage hole is wider than one entity.

**Also true and unmentioned:** `getItem` emits no edition marker of any kind
(`reference.ts:1002-1029`), so even with a working flag the caller can't tell which variant they got. That
overlaps Part D2.

**Actionable?** Yes, but **the live probe cannot run in this session** — there is no
`~/.dndbeyond-mcp/config.json` here, and `tests/live/setup.ts:30-33` throws without it. The live assertion must
be run by the user locally via `npm run test:live`. The derivation fallback needs no auth and can be built and
unit-tested immediately.

**Important?** **High.** This is the reviewer's own stated bar — confidently wrong output beats an error — and
it's the one item where the tool schema advertises a capability that may not exist. It also blocks the README's
claim at line 5 that items resolve "via D&D Beyond's `isLegacy` flag where present, or derived from the entity's
source book otherwise" — items currently have **no** derivation path, so the README overclaims today regardless
of what the probe finds.

**Effort: 4/10.** Small diff; the cost is the round-trip through a machine with live auth.

**Decision (user):** live assertion **and** `sources` fallback. Belt-and-braces — the param works either way.

**Steps**
1. Add to `tests/live/read-reference.test.ts` in the item `describe` block: fetch
   `ENDPOINTS.gameData.items()` raw via `client.get<DdbItem[]>` and assert the payload carries `isLegacy`
   (`expect(items.some(i => typeof i.isLegacy === "boolean")).toBe(true)`), plus that at least one item has
   `isLegacy === true`. Mirror the shape of the existing raw-`client.get` calls at `:262`/`:290`.
2. Add live `edition` assertions for `search_items` and `get_item` alongside it (a known cross-edition item —
   e.g. a reprinted magic item — collapsed to one row).
3. Make `DdbItem.isLegacy` **optional** (`isLegacy?: boolean`) at `reference.ts:901`, since the payload contract
   is unverified and a non-optional type is a lie TypeScript can't check.
4. Route items through the existing derivation: in `searchItems` (`reference.ts:911-916`) and `getItem`
   (`~:1006`), fetch config via `getGameConfigSafe` and apply
   `withLegacyFlag` (`reference.ts:539-549`) **only when the payload field is absent** — i.e. a small
   `isLegacy ?? isLegacyBySource(config, sources)` resolution, not a blanket overwrite (the native flag is
   authoritative where present, as it is for races and monsters).
5. Unit test in `tests/tools/reference-editions.test.ts`: items **without** `isLegacy` but **with** a legacy
   `sources[0].sourceId` still collapse correctly under `edition: "2014"`.
6. While here, close the sibling holes the reviewer's framing implied: add live edition assertions for
   `search_feats`/`get_feat` (`read-reference.test.ts:120-138`). Leaves two of the three named holes open,
   deliberately: `search_racial_traits` has no live test because the endpoint itself is broken (C4/Known
   issues) — a live edition assertion would just fail on the pre-existing 404, not test anything new. Class
   features' live-coverage hole stays open too, untouched by this step — it has its own hand-rolled
   collapse keyed on `classId`/`subclassName`/`name` (`reference.ts:2246-2262`), not `collapseByEdition`, so
   it isn't touched by D1 either. It's exercised well by unit tests (A2/A3/B1) but not by anything live; not
   blocking, but a real gap, not a closed one — worth a follow-up live test rather than silently dropping it.
7. **User runs `npm run test:live` locally** and reports the item-payload result. If `isLegacy` is present, the
   fallback is defensive and stays. If absent, the fallback is now load-bearing and the README's items claim is
   already accurate.

**Live result (2026-08-29, user's account):** `isLegacy` **is present** on the raw items payload — the
`sources`-derived fallback is defensive, not load-bearing, for items specifically. No code change needed; the
belt-and-braces derivation stays as insurance for accounts/response shapes where it might not be.

Running the live suite also caught a bad assumption in this plan's own step 6 test additions: the two new
`search_feats`/`get_feat` "both editions of Chef" tests assumed Chef's legacy printing is free/owned content like
Fighter (class) or Bag of Holding (item) — it isn't; this test account doesn't own that sourcebook, so only the
2024 Chef exists in `feats()`. Confirmed via a throwaway raw-payload dump, not a derivation bug: the single Chef
entry has no native `isLegacy` (as expected — feats never carry one) and resolves correctly through
`isLegacyBySource`. Rewritten to assert the actual invariant (a recognized source resolves to a definite
edition, never `[edition unknown]`/`*(edition undetermined)*`) unconditionally, with the stronger both-editions
assertion gated on it actually being true for the running account — mirroring the account-state-defensive
pattern already used elsewhere in this file (e.g. the `campaignId` subclass test). All 34 live reference tests
pass as of this run.

**Follow-up (2026-08-30):** the sourcebook gap above turned out to be `campaignId`-shaped — the user has a
campaign sharing Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, which the original manual test hadn't accounted for. Hardcoding
that campaign's ID into the "both editions" test was rejected: it's true for exactly one account, isn't stable
even for that account (sharing can be revoked), and commits more exposure than C3 already scrubbed for no
portability benefit. An env-var-gated variant was also rejected — nobody would know to set it, making it
equivalent to no assertion at all.

Instead, extended an existing pattern rather than inventing a new one: `describe("Live: campaignId support")`
already discovers the account's own campaigns live (`client.get<DdbCampaign[]>(ENDPOINTS.campaign.list(), ...)`)
and loops over them to find one that unlocks otherwise-unreachable content — for subclasses (the Oath of Glory
test from A2/A3). Feats, the entity that surfaced this whole gap, had no equivalent. Added "a campaign-scoped
feat lookup either matches or exceeds the unscoped one," mirroring the same loop. One wrinkle: `get_feat`'s
edition pick falls back to whichever printing exists rather than reporting "not found," so the unscoped-ownership
check here is "does `*(2014)*` appear," not absence of a not-found message. No campaign ID, name, or other
identifier appears in the test — it's discovered at runtime, so it stays meaningful (skip, not fail) for any
runner without a matching campaign. All 35 live reference tests pass.

### A2. `subclassOnlyFeatures` inverts when the base class has no features

**Accurate?** **Yes — and this is the most serious of the three.** Confirmed verbatim at
`src/tools/reference.ts:1653-1664`:

```ts
const baseIds = new Set((baseClass.classFeatures ?? []).map((f) => f.id));
return (subclass.classFeatures ?? []).filter((f) => !baseIds.has(f.id));
```

`DdbClass.classFeatures` is optional (`reference.ts:1480`). When it is empty or missing, `baseIds` is an empty
`Set`, nothing is excluded, and the function returns the subclass's **merged** base+subclass list — i.e. the
entire Paladin chassis reported as Oath of Glory features. The reviewer's example is precisely right.

The "graceful fallback" they refer to is `getSubclass` at `reference.ts:1881-1893`, and they're correct that it
covers the *opposite* case (zero features after the diff → "*No subclass-specific features returned…*"), not the
inverted one.

**Broader than stated:** the reviewer only named `get_subclass`. The same call sits inside `loadAllClassFeatures`
(`reference.ts:2205`), so `search_class_features` silently emits every base-class feature a second time,
attributed to `"Paladin (Oath of Glory)"` (the composite `className` built at `:2208`) — duplicated rows across
*every* subclass of the affected class, and then truncated to 30 (`:2273-2274`), so the real matches can get
pushed out of the result entirely. Both call sites need the guard.

**Actionable?** Yes, fully, with no external dependency. The guard is local and unit-testable with mocks.

**Important?** **Critical, and now rather than later.** Empty `baseClass.classFeatures` is not hypothetical — the
reviewer names two live triggers (unowned source, campaign-scoped narrowing), and this PR's own `campaignId`
work makes narrowed responses *more* likely. The output is confidently wrong and plausible-looking.

**Effort: 3/10.** Small, well-understood, no API dependency.

**Steps**
1. In `subclassOnlyFeatures` (`reference.ts:1653-1664`), change the signature to return a discriminated result —
   e.g. `{ features: DdbSubclassFeature[]; baseUnavailable: boolean }` — setting `baseUnavailable` when
   `(baseClass.classFeatures ?? []).length === 0` **and** the subclass has features. Do not silently return `[]`:
   that would trade a wrong answer for a missing one without explanation.
2. `getSubclass` (`reference.ts:1881-1893`): when `baseUnavailable`, suppress the feature list and emit an
   explicit note — "*Base-class feature list unavailable, so subclass-only features can't be isolated; the
   source may be unowned or campaign-narrowed. Try passing `campaignId`.*" Keep the existing zero-features
   fallback text for the genuine empty case; they are different conditions and deserve different messages.
3. `loadAllClassFeatures` (`reference.ts:2205`): when `baseUnavailable`, contribute **no** subclass rows for that
   class and track which classes were affected (e.g. accumulate a `baseUnavailableClasses: string[]` alongside
   the row list). Emit a standalone notice now if that count is nonzero, e.g. `*Note: N classes have unavailable
   base-class features; subclass-only features could not be isolated for them.*` This step doesn't depend on A3
   existing yet — A3 lands next and merges this into its own completeness notice per its step 6, so the two
   collapse into one line once both are in place rather than rendering as two separate notices.
4. Unit tests in `tests/tools/reference-subclasses.test.ts`: base class with `classFeatures: []` and with
   `classFeatures: undefined`, asserting the Paladin chassis does **not** leak into `get_subclass` output and
   that `search_class_features` emits no duplicated base rows.
5. Keep the existing live anti-leak assertion (`read-reference.test.ts:214`,
   `expect(text).not.toContain("Lay On Hands")`) green.

### A3. `Promise.allSettled` swallows per-class failures silently

**Accurate?** **Yes, on all three functions named.** Confirmed:

| Function | Location | Rejection handling |
|---|---|---|
| `loadAllClassFeatures` | `reference.ts:2160-2217` | `if (result.status !== "fulfilled") continue;` at `:2199` |
| `findSubclassMatches` | `reference.ts:1704-1739` | `continue` at `:1728` |
| `searchSubclasses` | `reference.ts:1741-1818` | `continue` at `:1773` |

None tracks a failure count. `searchSubclasses`'s terminal message (`:1806-1808`) is the same
"No subclasses found matching the search criteria." whether zero matched or all 24 fetches failed.

Two amplifiers the reviewer didn't mention, both of which make this more likely than it looks:
- The circuit breaker is `(5 failures, 30s)` (`server.ts:76`) and the limiter is 2 req/s, so a cold ~24-class
  fan-out takes ~12s — long enough for a mid-scan trip to reject *the entire remaining tail* at once.
- `DdbClient.get` caches on success only, so failed classes re-hit the network on every subsequent call for the
  next 24h while successful ones serve from cache — the incomplete result is *sticky and asymmetric*.

Also note `findSubclassMatches`'s own doc comment (`:1704-1710`) frames the skip as intentional for "a class with
no subclass content reachable for this account" — that's an **empty result**, but the code skips **rejections**
too. The comment documents a different behaviour than the code implements.

**Gap in the reviewer's suggestion:** `loadSpellCompendium` (`reference.ts:149-238`) does track `failureCount`
(`:156`) and throws on total failure (`:233-237`) — but it does **not** surface *partial* failures anywhere.
Mirroring it exactly would leave the reviewer's actual scenario (auth expires mid-scan, 5 of 24 classes fail)
just as silent as it is now. Worth flagging in the reply: the convention as written doesn't solve the problem
it's being cited for.

**Actionable?** Yes, fully. No external dependency.

**Important?** **High.** It is the reviewer's stated bar again, and unlike A1 it needs no live verification.

**Effort: 5/10.** Three call sites plus a shared helper plus output plumbing; mechanical but touches several
result paths.

**Decision (user):** surface partial failures too — go beyond the `loadSpellCompendium` convention.
`loadSpellCompendium` itself is **not** being retrofitted (keeps the diff out of pre-existing code); note the
inconsistency in the reply instead.

**Steps**
1. Add a small shared helper in `reference.ts` near the other fan-out utilities:
   `settleAll<T>(results: PromiseSettledResult<T>[]): { values: T[]; failureCount: number; total: number }`.
   One place to change, and it makes the three call sites read identically.
2. Rewrite the three `continue` loops (`:1728`, `:1773`, `:2199`) to use it.
3. **Throw on total failure**, matching the existing convention:
   `if (failureCount === total && total > 0) throw new Error("Failed to load subclasses: all requests failed. Check your authentication or try again later.")`.
   Catch at each tool boundary and return it as text, exactly as `searchSpells` does at `:249-255`.
4. **Surface partial failure** in tool output: when `0 < failureCount < total`, append a note —
   `*Note: 3 of 24 classes could not be loaded; these results may be incomplete.*` Thread the count out of
   `loadAllClassFeatures` (change its return to `{ rows, failureCount, total }`), `searchSubclasses`, and
   `findSubclassMatches` → `getSubclass`.
5. Make `getSubclass`'s not-found message (`reference.ts:1845-1853`) condition on the count: if any fetch failed,
   say so rather than asserting the subclass may not exist.
6. Fold A2's `baseUnavailable` classes into the same notice line so the user gets one honest completeness
   statement, not two.
7. Fix the stale doc comment at `reference.ts:1704-1710` to describe rejection handling as well as empty results.
8. Unit tests in `tests/tools/reference-subclasses.test.ts`: a mock client rejecting *some* classes (assert the
   note appears and the successful classes still render) and rejecting *all* (assert the thrown message reaches
   the tool result).

## Part B — Discussion items

### B1. Cold-cache cost on `search_class_features`

**Accurate?** **Yes, exactly.** `loadAllClassFeatures(client, campaignId)` (`reference.ts:2172`) takes neither
`className` nor `edition`; both are applied post-hoc as string filters at `reference.ts:2231-2240`, after the
full corpus is built. `resolveCandidateClasses` (`reference.ts:1669-1696`) — which `searchSubclasses` (`:1758`)
and `getSubclass` (`:1838`) both call *before* their fan-out — is never reached from this path. At 2 req/s
(`server.ts:76`) with ~24 classes across both editions, the reviewer's 10-13s cold figure is right.

Two additional facts: the assembled corpus is **not** cached (only the underlying HTTP responses are, 24h each),
so every call re-walks every class and re-runs `subclassOnlyFeatures`; and `search_class_features`'s tool
description (`server.ts:1048`) carries **no** cost warning, unlike `search_subclasses`/`get_subclass`, whose
`className` descriptions do (`server.ts:949`, `:967`).

**Actionable?** Yes, and cheaply — the helper already exists and is already used by two sibling tools.

**Careful — one behavioural subtlety.** The post-hoc filter at `:2237` matches against `ClassFeatureRow.className`,
which for subclass rows is the composite `` `${cls.name} (${sub.name})` `` (`:2208`). So today
`className: "Glory"` matches `"Paladin (Oath of Glory)"`. Narrowing before the fan-out with
`resolveCandidateClasses` would **break that**, because it resolves against base-class names only. Preserve the
behaviour: pre-filter only when `resolveCandidateClasses` returns a non-error match, and fall back to the full
fan-out when it doesn't, rather than erroring out.

**Important?** Medium. It's a latency and quota problem, not a correctness one — but it's cheap and the reviewer
explicitly offered the fix. Doing it now is better value than deferring.

**Effort: 4/10.** Mostly plumbing; the subtlety above is the only real thought required.

**Steps**
1. Change `loadAllClassFeatures`'s signature to accept `className?: string` and `edition?: Edition`.
2. Inside, after `withLegacyFlag`, call `resolveCandidateClasses(classes, className, edition)`. On a non-error
   result, fan out over those classes only; on `{ error }`, fan out over all (preserving composite-name matching).
3. Keep the existing post-hoc filters at `:2231-2240` untouched — they still do the subclass-name matching.
4. Add a cost note to the `search_class_features` `className` description in `server.ts:1052`, matching the
   wording already used at `server.ts:949`.
5. Unit test: `search_class_features({ className: "Paladin" })` issues subclass fetches for the Paladin classes
   only (assert on the mock's call count); `{ className: "Glory" }` still returns the Oath of Glory rows.

**Files:** `src/tools/reference.ts`, `src/server.ts`, `tests/tools/reference-subclasses.test.ts`

---

### B2. The edition heuristic degrades silently

**Accurate?** **Yes, and the silence is worse than the reviewer realised.** Traced end to end:

1. `getGameConfigSafe` (`reference.ts:74-77`) swallows the error with a bare `catch` and returns `undefined`.
   Nothing logged, nothing in the tool result.
2. `isLegacyBySource(undefined, …)` (`reference.ts:529-536`) → `config?.sources?.find(...)` is `undefined` →
   returns `false` for **every** entity. Whole corpus flagged 2024.
3. `pickByEdition` with `wantLegacy = true` finds nothing → `?? candidates[0]` returns the row anyway.
4. `editionSuffix(false, "2014")` (`reference.ts:551-563`) → `false !== true` → returns `" [2024]"`.

So the degraded path doesn't merely drop the tag — **it emits a confident `[2024]` mismatch tag on every row**,
which reads as "you asked for 2014, here's the 2024 one" when in fact nothing was determined at all. The `get_*`
detail paths are worse still: `getFeat:1153`, `getClass:1569`, `getSubclass:1864`, `getRace:2004`,
`getBackground:2123` each emit an unconditional `*(2024)*` header. That's an assertion, not a degradation.

The hardcoded set is confirmed: `LEGACY_SOURCE_CATEGORY_IDS = new Set([1, 23, 26])` (`reference.ts:527`), and
`sources?.[0]?.sourceId` (`:530`) confirms the primary-source assumption. The 2024 counterparts (24, 38) are
named in the comment but never checked — so there is **no tri-state**: "unknown edition" and "confirmed 2024" are
the same value. `GameConfig.sources` and `sourceCategoryId` are both optional (`reference.ts:20`), so a config
that fetches fine but omits categories degrades identically to a total outage.

Existing coverage confirms the gap: `tests/tools/reference-config-resilience.test.ts:24-45` only asserts the
*absence* of `*(Legacy)*` in the no-`edition` case. **No test passes `edition` while config is failing.**

**Actionable?** Yes. The reviewer's one-line note is the minimum; the tri-state is the real fix.

**Important?** Medium-high. Config outages are rare, but when one happens every edition-tagged answer is
confidently wrong, and the misleading-tag behaviour makes it worse than no tagging.

**Effort: 5/10** for the tri-state, **2/10** for the note alone. Recommend the tri-state — the note alone leaves
the wrong `[2024]` tag in place, which is the actual defect.

**Steps**
1. Change `isLegacyBySource` to return `boolean | undefined`: `undefined` when config is unavailable, when
   `config.sources` is missing, or when the `sourceId` isn't found. Keep `false` only for a *recognised* source
   outside the legacy set. Add category IDs 24 and 38 as the positive-2024 set so the distinction is real.
2. `withLegacyFlag` (`:539-549`) propagates `isLegacy?: boolean | undefined`.
3. `editionSuffix` (`:551-563`): when `isLegacy === undefined`, emit `" [edition unknown]"` rather than a
   confident `[2014]`/`[2024]`.
4. The five `get_*` detail headers (`:1153`, `:1569`, `:1864`, `:2004`, `:2123`): emit
   `*(edition undetermined)*` instead of `*(2024)*` when the flag is `undefined`.
5. Add a single result-level note when config was unavailable: "*Edition could not be determined — D&D Beyond's
   config endpoint was unreachable, so edition filtering was not applied.*" This is the reviewer's asked-for
   one-liner, now backed by real state.
6. Confirm `pickByEdition`/`collapseByEdition` still behave sanely with `undefined` (they already coerce via
   `Boolean()`; make the coercion explicit rather than incidental).
7. Extend `tests/tools/reference-config-resilience.test.ts` with the **missing** case: config failing **and**
   `edition: "2014"` passed — assert no `[2024]` tag and that the note appears.

**Files:** `src/tools/reference.ts`, `tests/tools/reference-config-resilience.test.ts`

### B3. `campaignId` shape — per-call vs. server-level default

**Accurate?** Yes. There's no server-level default — `AuthConfig` has only `cobaltSession`/`cookies`/`savedAt`,
and all 15 tools take `campaignId` as an optional per-call param only. An assistant that gets "not found" has
no signal that ownership was the cause. (Partly mitigated by A3: failures at least stop masquerading as
not-found, though unowned-but-uncalled-out content still does.)

**Decision:** Splitting the PR per the reviewer's request. The already-shipped per-call `campaignId` threading
stays in this PR, unchanged. The `defaultCampaignId`/`DDB_CAMPAIGN_ID` config default is deferred to a
follow-up PR — it was never implemented, so this needs no code change here. Design work for that follow-up is
already done and preserved in
[`docs/plans/2026-08-28-pr12-default-campaign-handoff.md`](2026-08-28-pr12-default-campaign-handoff.md).

**Effort: 0/10** — doc and reply only.

**Steps**
1. Confirm the split in the reply; commit to a follow-up PR for the default, pointing at the handoff doc.
2. No code changes for this item; C2's changelog entry doesn't mention a default.

**Files:** none.

## Part C — Housekeeping

### C1. Dangling doc filename in three comments

**Accurate?** **Yes, exactly as listed.** All three cite `dndbeyond-mcp-class-feature-handoff.md`, which exists
nowhere in the repo:
- `src/api/endpoints.ts:91`
- `src/tools/reference.ts:2166`
- `tests/live/read-reference.test.ts:196`

The real file is `docs/plans/2026-08-24-subclass-feature-independence-handoff.md`.

**Actionable / Important / Effort:** Trivially yes / low but free / **1/10**.

**Steps:** replace all three with the repo-relative path `docs/plans/2026-08-24-subclass-feature-independence-handoff.md`.

---

### C2. No version bump, no `v0.7.0` README entry

**Accurate?** **Yes.** `package.json:3` is `"version": "0.6.0"` and unchanged across all six PR commits (last
bump was `d31a0d0`, pre-PR). README "Fork changes" (`:146-155`) stops at `v0.6.0`, which describes only the
monster-resistances work. README `:5` says "current: `v0.6.0`" and `:25` instructs `git checkout v0.6.0`. So none
of this PR's surface — edition awareness, `get_class`/`get_race`/`get_background`/`get_feat`,
`search_subclasses`/`get_subclass`, the `search_class_features` fix, `campaignId` on 15 tools — is releasable by
dndtools.

**One discrepancy to flag, not to fix:** `git tag -l` and `git ls-remote --tags origin` are both **empty** on the
`SQLGuyJPS` fork, despite the README claiming "Released as annotated tags." The tags presumably live on
`dmjohnston89`. Tagging is the maintainer's call on merge — write the README/`package.json` entry, don't create
the tag.

**Actionable / Important / Effort:** Yes / high (it's what makes the work consumable) / **2/10**.

**Steps**
1. `package.json:3` → `"version": "0.7.0"`.
2. README `:5` → current `v0.7.0`; README `:25` → `git checkout v0.7.0`.
3. Add a `v0.7.0` bullet to "Fork changes" (`:155`). Lead with the real headline the reviewer identified —
   **`search_class_features` was dead since v0.5.0** (`class-feature/collection` 404s on every input) and is now
   rebuilt from `classes()` + `subclasses()` — then edition-aware lookups, the new detail tools,
   `search_subclasses`/`get_subclass`, the cross-class feature collapse fix, `campaignId`, and the spells/conditions
   edition-consistency pass (D1, D2a, D3, D4 — D2b's default flip gets its own bullet, step 4 below, not folded
   in here).
4. Add a **separate, clearly-labelled breaking-change bullet**: `get_condition` now defaults to 2024 instead of
   2014 (D2b) — this is the one condition dmjohnston89 attached when approving the flip, so it must be
   distinguishable from the additive edition-labelling changes, not folded silently into the same bullet.
5. Update README `:5`'s items claim to match whatever A1 lands.
6. Leave tag creation to the maintainer; mention it in the reply.

### C3. Handoff doc: stale §4 and personal details

**Accurate?** **Yes on both counts.**
- §4 "What currently works (do not regress)" (`docs/plans/2026-08-24-subclass-feature-independence-handoff.md:26-35`)
  lists `get_class` at lines 31-32 and `get_feat` at line 33 — but those tools were added by `b4864d9`, *inside
  this PR*. The doc was committed by `54eefa8`, after. It genuinely reads as if it predates work it postdates.
- Personal details, all in this one file (repo-wide grep for `Eledar` / `Veterans United` / `C:\` / `conta`
  returns exactly these):
  - line 16 — `C:\git\dndbeyond-mcp`
  - line 17 — `C:\Users\conta\.dndbeyond-mcp\config.json` (**includes the OS username**)
  - line 20 — character **Eledar Avestan**, campaign **"Veterans United"**
  - line 30 — `characterName="Eledar Avestan"` in the §4 table

No secrets, as the reviewer says — but the username and campaign name are gratuitous in an upstream repo.

**Actionable / Important / Effort:** Yes / low-medium (courtesy + future confusion) / **2/10**.

**Decision (user):** scrub.

**Steps**
1. Line 16 → `<repo root>`; line 17 → `~/.dndbeyond-mcp/config.json` (matches README `:40`).
2. Line 20 → a generic description: "a level-9 Aasimar Paladin (Oath of Glory) in a shared campaign."
3. Line 30 → `characterName="<test character>"`.
4. Rewrite §4's preamble to date-stamp it: "as of 2026-08-24, before the work described below" — and move the
   `get_class`/`get_feat` rows into a clearly labelled "added by this work" note, or drop them, so a later reader
   isn't misled about what pre-existed.
5. Leave line 18 (`%APPDATA%\Claude\...`) alone — it's a generic env var and matches README `:70`.

### C4. `search_racial_traits` gains a dead `edition` param

**Accurate?** **Yes, and correctly characterised as harmless.** `search_racial_traits` does take `edition`
(`server.ts:1074`, `src/types/reference.ts:81`), and the README (`:159`) correctly documents the tool as erroring
against the live API — `racial-trait/collection` nests its list under `data.definitionData`, which returns empty.
The README also correctly labels that a **pre-existing** defect, not introduced by this PR.

**Actionable?** Yes, but the right action is *nothing*. Removing the param would have to be re-added when the
endpoint is fixed, and it's consistent with every other search tool.

**Important?** Very low. Zero user-visible impact — the tool errors before the param is ever consulted.

**Effort: 1/10** (a one-line reply).

**Steps:** acknowledge in the reply; keep the param for consistency; note it's covered by the existing Known
issues entry. No code change.

### C5. README frames the permanently-excluded compendium-shared-content case as a future enhancement — **NEW, IN SCOPE (fixed 2026-08-29)**

**Found this session, not in the original review.** `README.md:63` and `:160` (both written by this PR's
`e706e39`) describe the compendium downloader never including campaign-shared content as "unexplored scope" and
call auto-including it "a reasonable future enhancement... hasn't been explored yet." That directly contradicts
the IP-caution decision reached later in this same review-response process — B3, follow-up decision #3, preserved
in [`docs/plans/2026-08-28-pr12-default-campaign-handoff.md`](2026-08-28-pr12-default-campaign-handoff.md) §4:
a snapshot persists to disk, so pulling in campaign-shared content risks leaving a user holding an offline copy
of a DM's paid sourcebook after that campaign's access or sharing is revoked. dmjohnston89 independently flagged
the same reasoning as "a genuinely good catch" in his 2026-08-28 comment and asked that the *code* comment
preventing this "doesn't get 'fixed' later" — the README was making exactly the opposite promise to readers.

**Accurate / Actionable?** Yes to both — this is a straightforward wording contradiction, not a design question.

**Important?** Medium. Nobody has acted on the README's claim yet, but leaving it in place invites a future
contributor (or a future instance of this project) to build the very thing B3 and the reviewer both agreed
against, with the README as their justification.

**Effort: 1/10.** Wording only, no code.

**Steps — done, landed 2026-08-29, ahead of the rest of this plan's implementation.**
1. ~~`README.md:63` — replace "That's out of scope for this branch... is a reasonable future enhancement but
   hasn't been explored yet" with language stating the exclusion is deliberate and permanent, with the IP
   rationale, matching the wording already agreed for the `downloader.ts` code comment.~~ Done.
2. ~~`README.md:160` (Known issues) — same correction; also reframe as "by design" rather than a defect/gap, since
   "Known issues" otherwise implies something pending a fix.~~ Done.
3. No changes needed to `src/compendium/downloader.ts` itself — its code-comment fix is already tracked under
   B3's follow-up decision #3 and travels with B3 to the deferred PR, since the downloader never took
   `defaultCampaignId` or `campaignId` at all (nothing in this PR's diff touches that file). Still pending, in
   the follow-up PR, not here.

### D1. `search_spells` has no `edition` param — **IN SCOPE**

**The issue.** `search_spells` (`server.ts:701-724`) is the **only** search tool without an `edition` param —
`search_monsters`, `search_items`, `search_feats`, `search_classes`, `search_subclasses`, `search_races`,
`search_backgrounds`, `search_class_features` and `search_racial_traits` all have one. Instead it hardcodes a
prefer-2024 collapse at `reference.ts:291-299`:

```ts
// Collapse 2014/2024 duplicates to one row per name (prefer the 2024 variant).
const byName = new Map<string, DdbSpell>();
for (const s of matchedSpells) {
  const existing = byName.get(s.definition.name);
  if (!existing || (existing.definition.isLegacy && !s.definition.isLegacy)) {
    byName.set(s.definition.name, s);
  }
}
```

Consequences, all three of which the PR's README now denies:
1. **You cannot search for 2014 spells at all.** `search_spells({ name: "Hunter's Mark" })` always returns the
   2024 variant. There is no parameter that changes this.
2. **No tag, so no way to detect it.** Unlike every other search tool, rows carry neither `*(Legacy)*` nor
   `[2014]`/`[2024]`. A 2014-only spell is returned indistinguishably from a 2024 one.
3. **Duplicated logic.** The collapse above re-implements `collapseByEdition` (`:497-516`), and `getSpell:368`
   re-implements `pickByEdition` (`:480-489`) — the two helpers this PR generalised for exactly this purpose.

Note `loadSpellCompendium` already keys its dedupe map by `` `${name}|${isLegacy ? "L" : "N"}` `` (`:169`,
`:187`, `:205`, `:223`), so **both editions are already in memory**. The data is there; only the selector is
missing. That makes this a genuinely cheap fix.

**Accurate / actionable / important?** Yes; yes, with no live dependency; **high** — this is the same
silently-wrong-output class as A1, and it's the entity a D&D assistant queries most.

**Effort: 3/10.**

**One design decision to get right.** `collapseByEdition(x, undefined)` returns the input **unchanged** — no
collapse. Swapping the hand-rolled loop for a bare `collapseByEdition(matchedSpells, params.edition)` would
therefore make duplicate spell rows appear when `edition` is omitted, a regression. Pass
**`params.edition ?? "2024"`** instead: identical default behaviour to today (collapse, prefer 2024), and now
expressible as `"2014"`.

**Steps**
1. Add `edition?: Edition` to `SpellSearchParams` (`src/types/reference.ts:13-20`) and wire `editionParam` into
   `search_spells` (`server.ts:713`) using the shared definition at `server.ts:683-688`.
2. Replace `reference.ts:291-299` with `collapseByEdition(matchedSpells, params.edition ?? "2024")` — **but not
   verbatim**. dmjohnston89 caught in review that this won't typecheck as written:
   `collapseByEdition<T extends EditionRanked>` requires `name` and `isLegacy` at the top level
   (`reference.ts:471-475`), but `DdbSpell` nests both under `.definition` (the existing hand-rolled loop reads
   `s.definition.name` at `:291-299`). This is the exact same projection problem already called out for
   `pickByEdition` in step 4 below — apply the same fix here: map each `DdbSpell` to an `EditionRanked`-shaped
   projection (`{ ...spell, name: spell.definition.name, isLegacy: spell.definition.isLegacy }`) before calling
   `collapseByEdition`, then map back, or give `collapseByEdition` a keyed-accessor overload if that reads
   cleaner across both call sites. Don't implement step 2 and step 4 with two different workarounds.
3. Add `editionSuffix(Boolean(spell.definition.isLegacy), params.edition ?? "2024")` to the row renderer at
   `~:314-320`. **Call this out in the reply:** with no `edition` passed, a 2014-only spell now renders `[2014]`
   where it previously rendered nothing. That is strictly more information, not a regression — but it is a
   visible output change.
4. Replace `getSpell`'s hand-rolled pick at `reference.ts:366-369` with `pickByEdition(candidates, params.edition)`.
   Verify the semantics match first — both are `find(...) ?? candidates[0]`, so they should be identical; the
   only wrinkle is that `pickByEdition` reads `.isLegacy` off the top level while spells nest it under
   `.definition`, so this needs a small projection or a `.map` to the `EditionRanked` shape.
5. Update README `:13`'s "pin a lookup to a specific ruleset" claim — it becomes true rather than aspirational.
6. Unit tests: `search_spells` with `edition: "2014"` returns the legacy variant; with no `edition` still
   collapses preferring 2024 (regression guard for step 2); a 2014-only spell renders with a `[2014]` tag.

### D2. `get_condition` diverges twice — **both halves IN SCOPE** (default flip approved 2026-08-28)

`get_condition` is not API-backed: it selects between two hardcoded tables
(`reference.ts:1424`, `CONDITIONS` / `CONDITIONS_2024`). So `collapseByEdition`/`pickByEdition`/`isLegacyBySource`
genuinely **do not apply** here, and nothing about the compendium machinery should be forced onto it. There is
also no `search_conditions` tool, so D1's missing-param issue has no analogue. Two narrower divergences remain:

**D2a — no edition marker in the output. IN SCOPE.**
`formatConditionDetails` (`:1446-1462`) emits only `# ${condition.name}`. Combined with D2b's (pre-flip) 2014
default, a caller asking for "grappled" got **legacy text, unlabelled**, with no way to tell. This is purely
additive — no behaviour change, no breaking change — and it is the same fix as D4 below.
**Effort: 1/10.** Add `*(2014)*` / `*(2024)*` to the header, matching the five `get_*` handlers at `:1153`,
`:1569`, `:1864`, `:2004`, `:2123`. Pass the resolved edition into the formatter.

**D2b — it defaults to 2014, everything else defaults to current. APPROVED — flip to 2024.**
`server.ts:899` says "Defaults to 2014", and `:1424`'s `params.edition === "2024" ? CONDITIONS_2024 : CONDITIONS`
implements it. Every other edition-aware tool defaults to current — the shared `editionParam`
(`server.ts:683-688`) reads "2024 (current)". So `get_condition("grappled")` returned 2014 rules while
`get_class("Fighter")` in the same conversation returned 2024 — a real trap for a model reasoning across tools,
and the PR's README `:13` implies uniform behaviour.

This was flagged as **dmjohnston89's own deliberate v0.2.0 design decision** and proposed rather than pushed,
since dndtools pins this server by tag and a silent flip changes answers for an existing consumer. He answered
directly in his 2026-08-28 review-response comment: *"yes, flip it to 2024 ... the cross-tool trap you describe
is real and matters more for an LLM-driven surface than the backward-compat cost ... just make sure it's called
out as a breaking change in the v0.7.0 entry rather than buried."* Building on his own authority to make that
call, this is now an implementation item, not a discussion item.

**Steps**
1. `server.ts:899` — change the description from "Defaults to 2014" to "Defaults to 2024 (current)", matching
   the shared `editionParam` wording at `:683-688`.
2. `reference.ts:1424` — flip the ternary: `params.edition === "2014" ? CONDITIONS : CONDITIONS_2024`.
3. `tests/tools/conditions.test.ts` — update the existing no-`edition`-passed assertions from the 2014 table to
   the 2024 table; add a case that `edition: "2014"` still reaches `CONDITIONS`.
4. Fold a clearly-labelled **breaking change** bullet into the C2 `v0.7.0` changelog entry (see C2's updated
   steps) — this is the one condition he attached to the approval, so it can't just ride along inside the
   general edition-consistency bullet.

### D3. `search_monsters` inlines its own edition tag — **IN SCOPE**

`searchMonsters` (`reference.ts:685-688`) hand-rolls the edition ternary instead of calling `editionSuffix`
(`:551-563`). It is logically identical for the `edition`-supplied branch but **omits the no-`edition`
`*(Legacy)*` branch entirely** — so `search_monsters` with no `edition` renders two same-name Goblin rows with no
way to tell them apart, unlike every other search tool.

Pre-existing since `v0.3.0`, but this PR built the shared helper it should be using, so folding it in is
justified rather than scope creep.

**Effort: 2/10.** Replace `:685-688` with `editionSuffix(Boolean(m.isLegacy), params.edition)`; add a unit test
asserting two same-name monsters render distinguishably with no `edition` passed. Note this is a deliberate
output change for the no-`edition` case — call it out in the reply so it isn't mistaken for a regression.

### D4. `get_*` detail output carries no edition label — **IN SCOPE**

`getItem` (`reference.ts:1002-1029`), `getMonster`, and `getSpell`/`formatSpellDetails` print no edition marker,
so a caller can't tell which variant `pickByEdition` handed them — even though all three accept `edition`.
`getItem`'s `edition` param is PR-era; the other two pre-date it. Directly compounds A1: an items fix is only
half useful if the answer is unlabelled.

**Effort: 3/10.** Add the same `*(2014)*`/`*(2024)*` header treatment the other five `get_*` handlers already use
(`:1153`, `:1569`, `:1864`, `:2004`, `:2123`), honouring B2's `undefined` tri-state. Unit tests per handler.

### D5. Module-level config cache never invalidated — **DEFERRED** (user declined)

`cachedConfig` (`reference.ts:55`) is process-global, never invalidated, not resettable, and survives a
`setup_auth` account switch. Already tracked at `BACKLOG.md:41`. Interacts with B2's heuristic. Mention in the
reply as known and tracked. **Effort if done: 3/10.**

### D6. Other findings — **DEFERRED**, reply-only

- `searchRacialTraits` uses a fixed non-campaign cache key `"game-data:racial-traits"` (`reference.ts:2317`)
  while every sibling uses `campaignCacheKey` — latent, but moot while the endpoint is broken.
- `TtlCache` (`src/cache/lru.ts:27-30`) evicts in insertion order, not LRU, despite the filename.
- `searchSubclasses` (`:1764-1780`) duplicates the fan-out/collect loop `findSubclassMatches` (`:1718-1737`)
  already implements. A3's `settleAll` helper partly converges them; full dedupe is optional.
- `campaign:${campaignId}:characters` cache-key collision between `src/tools/campaign.ts:82` and
  `src/resources/campaign.ts:106` — already flagged in `AUDIT.md:38-55`.

### D7. Edition preference is a per-tool hardcoded constant, not a user preference — **split: D7a IN SCOPE, D7b DISCUSSION ONLY**

Making spells and conditions edition-aware (D1/D2) exposed a question the single-maintainer codebase never had
to answer before: **"no `edition` passed" resolves to a different hardcoded default per tool** — `"2024"`
everywhere except `get_condition`'s deliberate `"2014"` (D2b). That was tolerable as one person's implicit
preference; it stops being tolerable the moment every compendium entity is edition-aware and more than one
person's preference exists. Full analysis, options, and a recommendation are in
[`docs/design/2026-08-26-edition-preference-design.md`](../design/2026-08-26-edition-preference-design.md).

**Not proposing to solve this in `#12`.** It's a cross-cutting design decision (global default vs. per-entity
override vs. a durable per-user preference mechanism), not a bug in this PR's diff, and it's precisely the kind
of question where dmjohnston89's own `get_condition` default shows reasonable people land differently. Deciding
it unilaterally inside a PR under review would be the same overreach D2b already avoids for the condition
default specifically — this generalizes that same caution to every entity at once.

**D7a — paving-the-way constant extraction. IN SCOPE, folds into D1's implementation.**
When D1 lands `params.edition ?? "2024"` at its two/three call sites (`reference.ts:291-299`/`:314-320`,
`getSpell`'s pick), use a single named `const DEFAULT_EDITION: Edition = "2024";` instead of repeating the string
literal. Zero behavior change today — it exists solely so a future config-driven default has one interception
point instead of a grep-and-replace. **Effort: 1/10.**

**D7b — the actual preference mechanism (global default, per-entity override, durable per-user config).
ENDORSED, DEFERRED TO ITS OWN FUTURE PR.**
Raised in the reply with the design doc linked, proposing the `preferences.edition` shape (reusing the same
`config.json` file B3's deferred `defaultCampaignId` would use, not a second mechanism). dmjohnston89 endorsed
the shape directly in his 2026-08-28 comment — *"`preferences.edition` living in the same `config.json` as
`defaultCampaignId` is the right structure ... But config-driven defaults mean the same tool call returns
different answers on different machines, which makes future bug reports harder to reason about — that deserves
its own PR where it's the main subject, not a rider on this one."* So this is no longer an open question to
raise; it's a settled decision to defer, and it travels with B3 to the same follow-up PR (both are new
mechanisms, not fixes to something broken — the same seam he drew for B3 applies here). **Effort: 0/10 here** —
no code in this PR.

**Files:** `docs/design/2026-08-26-edition-preference-design.md` (new); D7a touches whatever D1 already touches.

## Implementation order

Ordered so correctness lands before polish, and so shared helpers exist before their consumers need them.

1. **C1** — doc filename (3 lines, zero risk, unblocks nothing but gets it done). (**C5**'s README wording
   correction already landed (2026-08-29), ahead of implementation — nothing left to do here.)
2. **A2** — `subclassOnlyFeatures` guard. Most serious bug; self-contained.
3. **A3** — `settleAll` helper + partial-failure surfacing. Builds on A2's notice plumbing (share one output line).
4. **B2** — tri-state edition heuristic. Changes `editionSuffix` and the five `get_*` headers, which **D4 and
   D2a extend** — so it must land before them.
5. **A1** — items: optional `isLegacy` + `sources` fallback + live assertions. Depends on B2's tri-state for
   correct "unknown" handling. **Blocked on the user running `npm run test:live` locally.**
6. **D1** — `search_spells` gains `edition`; spells move onto `collapseByEdition`/`pickByEdition`/`editionSuffix`.
   Do this **after** B2 so the tri-state is already in `editionSuffix`. (No hard dependency on A1: A1 only
   changes how `isLegacy` is derived for items before `withLegacyFlag` runs — it doesn't touch
   `collapseByEdition`/`pickByEdition` themselves. Sequenced after A1 here simply because A1 is a blocker and D1
   isn't, not because anything D1 needs is unstable until A1 lands.) Fold in **D7a** here — introduce the
   `DEFAULT_EDITION` constant instead of a repeated `"2024"` literal at each new call site.
7. **D4** — edition labels on `getItem`/`getMonster`/`getSpell`, honouring B2's tri-state. Folds naturally into
   D1's `getSpell` change — do them together.
8. **D2a + D2b** — edition label on `get_condition` output, and the approved default flip (2014 → 2024).
   Independent of everything else; small and self-contained, plus test updates.
9. **D3** — `search_monsters` uses `editionSuffix`.
10. **B1** — pre-fan-out narrowing in `loadAllClassFeatures` + cost note in the tool description.
11. **C3** — scrub and date-stamp the handoff doc.
12. **C2** — version bump to v0.7.0 across `package.json` and README (last, so the changelog entry is accurate).
    Update README `:13`'s "across all of them" claim to match what D1/D2a actually deliver. `campaignId`
    threading is already-shipped surface and gets its usual mention; no `defaultCampaignId` entry — per B3,
    that's deferred to a follow-up PR, matching the reviewer's requested split, not built here.
13. **B3 / C4** — reply to the reviewer confirming the split is executed exactly as he requested: this PR ships
    A1–A3, C1–C3, B1, B2, and the full edition-consistency pass (D1, D2a, D2b, D3, D4); `defaultCampaignId`/
    `DDB_CAMPAIGN_ID` (B3) and the preference-mechanism design (D7b) move to a follow-up PR. No code for this
    step — D2b and D7b are no longer open questions (both resolved 2026-08-28, see D2b/D7b above); this step is
    reply-and-bookkeeping only.

Steps 1-4 and 6-12 need no live auth and can be completed in one pass. Step 5 pauses for the live run.

## Verification

**Every step:**
```bash
npm ci
npx tsc --noEmit          # currently exit 0 — keep it there
npm test                  # currently 344 passed / 32 files — must not regress
```
Expect the count to rise; every new test file and case below adds to it.

**Targeted:**
```bash
npx vitest tests/tools/reference-subclasses.test.ts        # A2, A3, B1
npx vitest tests/tools/reference-config-resilience.test.ts # B2
npx vitest tests/tools/reference-editions.test.ts          # A1, D1, D3, D4
npx vitest tests/tools/conditions.test.ts                  # D2a, D2b
npx vitest tests/api/endpoints.test.ts                     # unchanged
```

**Live (user's machine only — requires `~/.dndbeyond-mcp/config.json`):**
```bash
npm run setup       # if the session has expired
npm run test:live   # A1's item-payload probe is the gating result
```
Live tests are correctly excluded from `npm test` (separate `vitest.live.config.ts`) — keep it that way.

**Manual MCP smoke tests** (build, point a client at `build/src/index.js`):
- `get_subclass("Oath of Glory")` — Paladin chassis must **not** appear (A2).
- `get_subclass` with an unowned/campaign-narrowed source — expect the explicit "base-class features
  unavailable" note, not a wrong list (A2).
- `search_class_features({ className: "Paladin" })` — time it cold; should be ~1-2 requests' worth, not ~12s (B1).
  Then `{ className: "Glory" }` — must still return Oath of Glory rows (B1's subtlety).
- `search_items({ name: "...", edition: "2014" })` — assert the returned variant is genuinely the 2014 one (A1).
- `search_monsters({ name: "goblin" })` with **no** `edition` — the two rows must be distinguishable (D3).
- `search_spells({ name: "hunter's mark", edition: "2014" })` — must return the **legacy** text, which is
  impossible today. Then the same call with no `edition` — must still return one row, preferring 2024 (D1's
  regression guard).
- `get_condition("grappled")` with no `edition` — must return 2024 (SRD 5.2) text by default (D2b) and state
  which edition it returned (D2a); `edition: "2014"` must still return the legacy text.
- Simulate a config outage (block `/api/config/json`) with `edition: "2014"` — expect
  "edition could not be determined", **not** a `[2024]` tag (B2).
- `get_item`, `get_monster`, `get_spell` — each response header must state the edition returned (D4); confirm
  against `get_class`/`get_subclass`/`get_race`/`get_background`/`get_feat`, which already do this.

- **2026-08-25** — dmjohnston89 posts his initial PR #12 review: three blockers (A1–A3), three discussion
  items (B1–B3), four housekeeping items (C1–C4).
- **2026-08-28 (morning)** — a short holding comment is posted to the PR thread confirming the review is being
  worked through; no revisions ready yet.
- **2026-08-28** — this plan document, the edition-preference design doc, and the default-campaign handoff doc
  are shared with dmjohnston89 directly (read via the branch, not a PR comment). He responds in
  [PR comment #5454160630](https://github.com/dmjohnston89/dndbeyond-mcp/pull/12#issuecomment-5454160630):
  confirms all three blockers as described, approves D2b's default flip (with the breaking-change-note
  condition), endorses D7b's `preferences.edition` shape but asks it be deferred to its own follow-up PR,
  catches the D1 step 2 typecheck gap, asks for the PR split (this PR vs. a follow-up for B3/D7b), and asks
  for the planning-doc commits to be squashed to their final state. His decisions are folded directly into
  D2b, D7b, D1, and the Implementation order above, not restated here.
- **2026-08-29** — plan updated per that comment (D2b, D7b, D1 step 2, Implementation order); the README's
  compendium-downloader claim corrected to match the already-agreed IP-caution stance (C5); planning-doc
  commits since `e706e39` squashed to one. A round-2 summary is posted to the PR thread separately — see the
  actual PR comment, once posted, for its exact wording rather than this document.
